        <h1>Rules & Rewards</h1>
        Please have a look at the fine print below before starting your hunt!
        <ul>
          <li>First come, first serve. Issues that have already been submitted by another user or are already known to the Ethereum team are not eligible for bounty rewards.</li>
          <li>A submission is accepted if it leads to code or a config change in the Ethereum CPP or Go client. NOTE: Python and other clients are not in scope (yet). </li>
          <li> Submissions must include a well-written description of the vulnerability and detailed steps for how to reproduce it.</li>
          <li> You can start or fork a private chain or use our test net for bug hunting. Please respect the Ethereum main net and refrain from attacking it, even if you found an exploit.</li>
          <li> Ethereum's core development team, employees and all other people paid by the Ethereum project, directly or indirectly, are not eligible for rewards.</li>
          <li> Developers or companies directly involved in monetising or profiting in any kind from the Ethereum codebase ("Ethereum fork") are exempt from rewards.</li>
          <li> Ethereum websites are NOT part of the bounty program.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The value of rewards paid out will vary depending on severity of impact. Rewards for minor 'harmless' bugs start at <b>0.05 BTC</b>. Major bugs, for example leading to consensus issues, will be rewarded up to <b>5 BTC</b>. Much higher rewards are possible (up to <b>25 BTC</b>) in case of very severe vulnerabilities. Beyond monetary rewards, every bounty is also eligible for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Listing on our leaderboard with points accumulating over the course of the program.</li>
          <li>Personal inscription in the Ethereum namereg once it's live.</li>
          <li>An exclusive, limited edition Ethereum Bountyhunter t-shirt (picture coming soon!)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bounties are awarded at the discretion of the Ethereum dev team. They depend on several variables:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>Impact. Example of a "zero-day" vulnerability would be ability to arbitrarily steal Ether, or anything that would require an emergency hard-fork of the blockchain. Example of low-impact could be finding block validation rules are wrongly ordered such that function or availability of the network is unaffected but there is potential for resource abuse / DoS of individual nodes due to unnecessary checks.</li>
          <li>Quality of description. Higher rewards are paid for clear, well-written submissions, FAQ section.</li>
          <li>Quality of reproducibility. Please include test code, scripts and detailed instructions. The easier it is for us to verify, the higher the reward. For network attacks, this could also be a simulation. Please see the wiki and repos if you want to know more about our test suit: <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/tests/blob/develop/StateTests/stExample.json">Example test</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/tests/wiki">wiki</a>.</li>
          <li>Quality of fix, if included. Higher rewards are paid for submissions with clear description of how to fix the issue. Bonus points for Github pull request!</li>
