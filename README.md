Bounty program site for Ethereum

## Quick start:

[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com)
```
curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh

#from the project root:
meteor
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. Enjoy.

## Project structure

Any code inside the `server/` directory is only loaded on the server while any code inside the `client/` directory will only be loaded on the client. Anything outside of these dirs will be loaded on both sides.

Also, Meteor has a very bizarre file loading order: anything you put inside a `lib` folder will be loaded before anything else in the directory, while a file called `main.js` will be loaded last. This is useful to keep in mind when making any global declarations.

### Templates

Please make sure to keep your "master" templates skinny (by breaking them down into subtemplates) and any other templates scoped to a single logical element of the page. E.g. if you have a page that looks like

```html
<template name="peopleAndPets">
  <section id="people">
    <ul>
      ... list of people
    <ul>
  </section>
  <section id="pets">
    <ul>
      ... list of pets
    <ul>
  </section>
</template>
```

it's best to break it down into 3 templates:

```html
<template name="peopleAndPets">
  {{> people }}
  {{> pets }}
</template>

<template name="people">
  <section id="people">
    <ul>
      ... list of people
    <ul>
  </section>
</template>

<template name="pets">
  <section id="pets">
    <ul>
      ... list of pets
    <ul>
  </section>
</template>
```

Also, please make sure to have only one `template` tag per file. In the example above each `template` should be defined in it's own file (e.g. `people-and-pets.html`, `people.html`, `pets.html`)

This way the app's html becomes very modular and easy to restructure.

## Configuration

### Environment variables

Env var settings are not part of the repo and not going to be (for security reasons). You'll need to add the config file manually. To do that create a `config/settings.json` file with your environment variables in JSON format e.g.
```js
{
  "GITHUB_CLIENT_ID": "abc123",
  "GITHUB_SECRET": "xyz098"
}
```
then run meteor with
```
meteor --settings config/settings.json
```

### Github login

The website supports Github signup but you'll need to register an application on Github first if you want to try it out locally. Go to `https://github.com/settings/applications` and click "Register new application". Fill in the fields with pretty much anything except for the callback one: this needs to be your localhost address, e.g. `http://localhost:3000`. Click "Register application". You're alsmost done. Now copy the client ID and client secret into your `config/settings.json` file as values for `githubClientId` and `githubSecret` respectively. Github login should work for you now.
